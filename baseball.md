# POSTECH Baseball Club: Tachyons

POSTECH-KAIST SCIENCE WAR is a rivaly match between the two universities and has been held every year since 2002. And baseball is one of the events of the game.

I played as catcher, first-base man, and cleanup hitter (4th batting order) on 2018, and 2022.

And I also contributed as a team leader as well.
